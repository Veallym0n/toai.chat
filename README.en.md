### Parameters
+ Here's a summary of the parameters you might use, along with some tips:

    | Command | Description |
    |---|---|
    | `-N` or `--no-buffering` | Disable curl's buffering to enable streaming output |
    | `-d` | Specify the prompt you want to send |
    | `-F'image=@file'` | Upload a file to AI |
    | `-F'model=deepseek-r1'` | Choose the model to use |
    | `-F'prompt=something'` | When using `-F`, you must use `-F'prompt='` to specify the prompt |
    | `-F'sp=you are Querky'` | Use a custom system prompt |
    | `-H'sp:you good at ascii art'` | Same as `-F'sp='`, used to set the system prompt |
    | `-H'model:phi'` | Same as `-F'model='`, used to select the model |

+ Todo:
    - [ ]  MCPServer Support (I've complained about the MCP protocol many times)
    - [x]  Intelligent Agent Role System (Already available but still in testing, hidden from you - -)
    - [x]  Plug-in RAG (Also in testing, do you believe it?!)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

#### üé® Customize AI Roles

You can customize the AI's system prompt by using the `-F'sp='` or `-H'sp:'` parameters to tailor the AI's role.

```shell
curl toai.chat -N -H'sp: You are a humorous comedian' -d "Tell a joke"
```

#### üñºÔ∏è Upload Images

You can upload local images to AI for image-related processing using the `-F'image=@file'` parameter.

```shell
curl toai.chat -N -F'image=@/path/to/image.jpg' -F "prompt=Describe this image"
```

#### üß† Select Models

You can select different AI models using the `-F'model='` or `-H'model:'` parameters.

```shell
curl toai.chat -N -F'model=gpt-4' -F "prompt=Explain quantum mechanics"
```

### üìù Examples

Here are some examples showcasing the powerful capabilities of Toai.chat.

1.  **Basic Conversation**

    ```shell
    curl toai.chat -N -d "Hello, who are you?"
    ```

2.  **Translation**

    ```shell
